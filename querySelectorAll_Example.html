🔍 Explanation
HTML Structure:

There are five <button> elements.
Each button has the same class: .js-add-to-cart.
JavaScript:

document.querySelectorAll('.js-add-to-cart') selects all buttons.
The for loop iterates over the NodeList of buttons.
buttons[i].addEventListener('click', () => { ... }) adds a click event listener to each button.
When a button is clicked, it logs:
